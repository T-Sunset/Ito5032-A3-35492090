   <p>Volunteering with the Prism Project provides practical experience, training, and the chance to support other young people in a safe, structured environment. Volunteers receive orientation and ongoing supervision, and we strive to create roles that are rewarding and manageable alongside study or work.</p> <p>We’re especially keen to support volunteers from diverse backgrounds and lived experiences; if you’re interested, submit an expression of interest and we’ll invite you to an informal chat to discuss suitable roles, DBS checks (if required), and available training.</p>
